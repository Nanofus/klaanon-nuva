# Klaanon Nuva

This is a simple SvelteKit-based frontend for a WordPress backend.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

The app is automatically deployed upon commits to the `main` branch.
